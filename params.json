  "body": "# The **Official** Raptor Open Source Project Site\r\nI no longer want to be affiliated in any way with fics. I hate the place and its admins who seem to enjoy joining with trolls to abuse its users. There will never be another release of Raptor. Go to other chess servers screw FICS. I will leave this around in case anyone finds it useful but I am done with it for good. \r\n\r\nAnd this Slek that tried to befriend me then whined to admins after harassing me and created countless dupes is the cause of it. The jerk only logs in without timeseal to avoid dupe detection and has created countless dupes to harass not only me but likely others as well. Fics admins side with him, fuck FICS. I will never log into it again. I encourage you to do the same and find a better server. Fics is garbage when trolls can manipulate admins and run the show.\r\n\r\nRaptor is a multiplatform chess interface for [freechess.org](freechess.org) (aka FICS).\r\n\r\nBinary Downloads: (Requires Java JRE 6+ 64 bit)\r\n * [Raptor 1.0 Mac OSX (64 bit)] (https://github.com/Raptor-Fics-Interface/Raptor/releases/download/v1.0/Raptor_v1.0_OS_X_Cocoa_x86_64.dmg)\r\n * [Raptor 1.0 Linux (64 bit)] (https://github.com/Raptor-Fics-Interface/Raptor/releases/download/v1.0/Raptor_v1.0_Linux_x86_64_GTK2.zip)\r\n * [Raptor 1.0 Windows (64 bit)] (https://github.com/Raptor-Fics-Interface/Raptor/releases/download/v1.0/Raptor_v1.0_Windows64.zip)\r\n * [Change Log] (https://github.com/Raptor-Fics-Interface/Raptor/wiki/Change-Log)\r\n\r\n**To install/run in Linux:** (*Yes i know it needs a package install*)\r\n  * Download [Raptor 1.0 Linux (64 bit)] (https://github.com/Raptor-Fics-Interface/Raptor/releases/download/v1.0/Raptor_v1.0_Linux_x86_64_GTK2.zip)\r\n  * Unzip in a directory.\r\n  * Open up terminal.\r\n  * cd to dir unzipped.\r\n  * run './raptor'\r\n\r\n**To install in OS X:** (*Planning on trying to get this added to the app store*)\r\n  * Download [Raptor 1.0 Mac OSX (64 bit)] (https://github.com/Raptor-Fics-Interface/Raptor/releases/download/v1.0/Raptor_v1.0_OS_X_Cocoa_x86_64.dmg)\r\n  * Double click dmg.\r\n  * Open finder window.\r\n  * Drag Raptor.app into Applications.\r\n  * Double click on Raptor in Applications (*You might have to go into System Preferences -> Security & Privacy to allow Raptor to execute*).\r\n\r\n**To install in Wndows:** (*Yes i know it needs an installer*)\r\n  * Download [Raptor 1.0 Windows (64 bit)] (https://github.com/Raptor-Fics-Interface/Raptor/releases/download/v1.0/Raptor_v1.0_Windows64.zip)\r\n  * Unzip in a directory.\r\n  * Double click on Raptor.jar\r\n\r\n## Release 1.0.
