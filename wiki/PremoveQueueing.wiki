=Premove Queueing=

This page is a description of how premove queueing works in Raptor. It is probably not what you expect, as it is not conditional premove.

First you have to enable it. In Preferences -> ChessBoard -> Behavior check both premove enabled and queued premove enabled.

How it works:
As you premove, each move is added to the queue. You can see the queue under the Premoves label while you are playing.

After your opponent moves the following pseudo code executes:

For each move in queue
   *  Delete move from queue.
   *  If move is legal, make move and remove from queue. Break out of the loop.
   *  If move is illegal, remove move from queue.

If you click the red X under the premoves label, the entire queue is emptied.

If i remember correctly, JohnTheGreat and I came up with this concept back when I was first writing raptor.
