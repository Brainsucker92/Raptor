===How to Create a Chess Set in Raptor (v.98+) ===
All raptor chess sets can be found in resources/set after you install Raptor. They consist of a directory with the name of the set and a bunch of numbered directories containing pngs of different sizes. Images need to be created for all sizes: 8x8 - 100x100. The numbered directories represent the size of the image (e.g. Eyes/8 contains all of the 8x8 pngs for the Eyes chess set).

All of the sets for Raptor are generated by a program called Raptor Set Creator. This program uses [http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/ Batik] to convert svg graphics files into the different sized pngs needed.

To create a set using Raptor Set Creator you will need:
   *  a good svg editor. I suggest [http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape]. It is fantastic and free.
   *  Java 1.5 JRE or higher installed on your machine.
   *  to download and unzip [http://raptor-chess-interface.googlecode.com/files/RaptorSetCreator.zip RaptorSetCreator.zip] in a new directory.
  
The read me in the file you unzipped describes how to use the set creator.

==Guidelines==
Make the size of the image fairly small. You can work on it in a large size like 500x500, but when you finally save it off scale it back. Inkscape has some options to scale proprtionally. Since its svg, you will not lose any detail when its scaled back. It just speeds up the conversion of svg to png greatly. Most of the sets use 100x100 or sizes close to that for this very reason. Anything below 200x200 will be pretty fast, but larger sizes really have speed issues in some operating systems. 

Use square image sizes instead of rectangles. Also use an even number for the sizes. This allows for almost perfect scaling when the images are converted into pgn. 

When I converted the svg sets in Raptor I tried to made all of the svg images in a particular set the same size. Then when I wanted a pawn to be smaller than another piece type I could just adjust it within the image and it came out scaled correctly in raptor. If you take this approach you can make pieces of different sizes, i.e. pawns smaller than other pieces and queens and kings a bit taller, etc. It will also prevent some pieces from taking up the entire square if that is not what you intended. In many of the sets the rooks were very prominent and I had to scale them back in size a bit so they looked nicer. You can also play around with the centering if you do this. In some sets I have pawns with a bit of margin underneath them. This has a nice effect in Raptor when the pieces are displayed. 

If you do use images or effects in Inkscape you may need to embed the images for them to appear. You can do this with Extensions -> Images -> Embed Images.

Don't forget to include the author.txt and license.txt license file when you submit your set to be included in Raptor. These files will not only give you credit for your work, but you can supply the open source license you would like your set to be placed under. As long as the license is BSD compatible you can use what ever you want.


==Square Backgrounds==
You can now create square backgrounds from SVG files using the set creator. This is useful if you have square backgrounds that contain a pattern that doesnt crop or scale well.
