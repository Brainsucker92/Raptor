I was playing around with fonts and found some neat ones here is an example:

First find a LCD Font you like from: http://www.dailyfreefonts.com
The one in the above image is called Atomic Clock Radio. You can get it here: http://www.dailyfreefonts.com/fonts/charmap/2869-Atomic-Clock-Radio.html

To set it up on OS X just download the file (for osx), and unzip it. Place the ttf file in your user/library/Fonts directory. 

Next go into File/Properties in Raptor and select Chess Board/Clock Preferences. Click on clock font and select Atomic Clock Radio. Click apply and ok on the dialog and you are done. 

One thing to beware of. Raptor needs a monospaced font for Clocks, otherwise the clock will look strange when it blinks in HH:SS mode.

Feel free to post comments on other fonts you enjoy here.
