Raptor does not implement the babas !BCS->(SOUND) chess sounds and never will. However, rookcheck wanted to set it up and we wrote a script to do it. Here are the directions:

  # Copy over all of the babas chess sounds into the Raptor/resources/sounds/bughouse directory.
  # Now you need to add a regular expression script. Open up File->Preferences
  # Click on Regular Expression Scripts on the left.
  # Type in "babasSounds" for the script name.
  # Type in "Plays !BCS->(sound) babas chess sounds." for the description.
  # Click edit to the right of regular expression.
  # Enter
{{{
.*\!BCS\-\>\(.*
}}}
    and click OK.
  # Next click edit on the right of Script.
  # Enter
{{{
String message = context.getChatEvent().getMessage();
int bcsIndex = message.indexOf("!BCS->(");
if (bcsIndex != -1) {
   int closingParen = message.indexOf(")",bcsIndex);
   if (closingParen != -1) {
      String soundName = message.substring(bcsIndex + 7,closingParen);

      File file = null;
      new File("resources/sounds/bughouse/").listFiles(new FileFilter() {
				public boolean accept(File pathName) {
                    if (pathName.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(soundName + ".wav")) {
					    file = pathName;
                    }
                    return false;
				}
			});

      if (file != null) {
          String fileName = file.getName();
          int dotIndex = fileName.indexOf(".");
          context.playBughouseSound(fileName.substring(0,dotIndex));
      }
   }
}
}}}
     and click ok.
  #  Enter save at the bottom.
  #  Now click the left arrow to activate the script.
  #  Now restart raptor. It has to reload all of the bughouse sounds.
  #  When someone sends you a !BCS->(SOUND) now it should play it. e.g. !BCS->(applause)
