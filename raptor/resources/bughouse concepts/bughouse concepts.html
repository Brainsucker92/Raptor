am one a few players who play with an equal desire to help my partner
win as I do to win my own board. (The strategies I use for this will
be in the concepts). It doesn't matter one bit to me who mates, a win
is a win. Because of my style my partner has opportunities to play
way above his level and win games vs much stronger players, often to
the disbelief of my opponents. Fun times :)</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It's
incredibly important to take responsibility for the team's results.
There's no &quot;my partner played bad and I crushed&quot;. You win
and lose as a team. Sometimes frustration happens, but it's so much
easier it is to play well if you're focused on what you can do
instead of whether your partner is playing good enough.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="en" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Partners
are so dependent on eachother. If your partner loses, there's nearly
always something you could have done better and vice versa. Even if
they made silly mistakes, I try my best to realize it's not always
their fault if they lose and try and adjust my game to help them win.</FONT></P>

sometimes encounter some toxic players (rarely over 2200) who never

for beginning to intermediate level player, &quot;sit&quot; should be
used very often if you are up or even on time. Flipping the roles
around, if you were Black you would definitely want your partner to
sit so white does not get that bishop. It's better to error on the
side of saying Sit too much than too little, and sometimes I say it
as many as 10 times a game just to avoid some nuances.</FONT></P>
